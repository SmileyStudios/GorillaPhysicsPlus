Gorilla Physics Plus is being renamed and reworked, for those who were waiting for this Gorilla Tag + Unity Physics project, Im Sorry to say that its not happening here.

JUST NOTE! This doesnt have anything to do with the creator of the original GorillaPhysics, from what I can see they just wanted to show It to the world even If It dosent work on Unity 6.

Instead, Im going to put this on a different github page, with new systems, same physics, fixed scripts. some scripts will be shared over, some not so much.

Once again! this doesnt mean its cancelled. Think of this as a rebranding and a new page!

Rest assured, Gorilla Physics Plus Isnt going away, Its going to somewhere else!
